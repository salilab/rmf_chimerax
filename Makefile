# The "make" targets are:
#    wheel: build a Python wheel in "dist" directory
#    install: build wheel and install
#    test: run all unit tests (in a mock environment)
#    test-chimerax: run all unit tests within ChimeraX itself
#    debug: run ChimeraX with debugging flag set
#    clean: remove files used in building wheel

# Theoretically, you should only need to change
# 1. the CHIMERAX_APP definition (or define in environment),
# 2. the "devel build" and "devel install" commands in the
#    "install" and "wheel" targets, (e.g., if you want to
#    install into ChimeraX.app instead of for the current
#    user, add "user false"), and
# 3. the "generated_files" and "clean_generated_files" targets
#    (e.g., if you need to generate files such as self-signed
#    certificates or data files from template expansion)
