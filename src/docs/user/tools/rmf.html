<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: RMF Viewer</h3>
<p>
The <b>RMF Viewer</b> tool displays information contained in models
read from RMF files.</p>

<p>
The <b>RMF model</b> combo box at the top of the tool allows selecting from
all currently open models that have associated RMF data.</p>

<p>
The <b>Features</b> frame shows all features in the file (these are typically
restraints). Selecting one or more features in this list will select the
corresponding pseudobonds in the structure.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Hierarchy</b> frame shows the hierarchy of nodes in the selected
RMF file. If there is representation at multiple resolutions, the resolutions
are shown along the top of this frame as checkboxes. Only nodes corresponding
to the selected resolution(s) are shown.</p>

<p>
One or more nodes can be selected and the corresponding structure or bonds
selected, hidden, shown or viewed (brought into the center of the screen)
using the buttons on the right side. The "Only" button will show only the
selected nodes in the model and hide everything else (if no node is selected,
this will operate on the top-level node).</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For more fine grained control, note that residues are given
the following <a href="../atomspec.html#attributes">attributes</a>
which can be used in
<a href="../commands/select.html">ChimeraX selections</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>rmf_name</b>: The name of the containing molecule</li>
  <li><b>copy</b>: The (integer) copy number, usually 0 or unspecified
  for the primary copy of a molecule</li>
  <li><b>resolution</b>: The IMP/PMI resolution of the representation,
  usually 0 for atomic, 1 for a single bead per residue, 10 or more for
  multiple residues per bead</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, all of the non-primary copies could be selected with</p>

<p><b>select ::copy&gt;0</b></p>

<p>or only the bead-per-residue representation
of the primary copy of Tub0 could be selected with</p>

<p><b>select ::rmf_name="Tub0" &amp; ::copy=0 &amp; ::resolution=1</b></p>

<p>
The <b>Provenance</b> frame shows information extracted from the RMF file
about how it was generated. This may include information on the software used,
the sampling algorithm, any PDB files used as starting guesses for subunits,
or additional files used as input by restraints (such as electron microscopy
density maps). The Load button will attempt to load any external files
referenced by the selected item(s) in the list (this requires the file to
be present on disk and to be in a format recognized by ChimeraX). (Note that
if multiple chains are read from a single structure file, loading any item
that references one of those chains will load all chains, as a single structure,
as this is more efficient than creating a separate model for each chain.)
</p>

<p>The <b>Features</b>, <b>Hierarchy</b> and <b>Provenance</b> frames can be
resized or even hidden by dragging the sliders that are between each
frame.</p>
