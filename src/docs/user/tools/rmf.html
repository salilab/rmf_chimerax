<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: RMF Viewer</h3>
<p>
The <b>RMF Viewer</b> tool displays information contained in models
read from RMF files.</p>

<p>
The <b>RMF model</b> combo box at the top of the tool allows selecting from
all currently open models that have associated RMF data.</p>

<p>
The <b>Features</b> frame shows all features in the file (these are typically
restraints). Selecting one or more features in this list will select the
corresponding pseudobonds in the structure.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Hierarchy</b> frame shows the hierarchy of nodes in the selected
RMF file.
One or more nodes can be selected and the corresponding structure or bonds
selected, hidden, shown or viewed (brought into the center of the screen)
using the buttons on the right side.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Provenance</b> frame shows information extracted from the RMF file
about how it was generated. This may include information on the software used,
the sampling algorithm, any PDB files used as starting guesses for subunits,
or additional files used as input by restraints (such as electron microscopy
density maps). The Load button will attempt to load any external files
referenced by the selected item(s) in the list (this requires the file to
be present on disk and to be in a format recognized by ChimeraX).
</p>

<p>The <b>Features</b>, <b>Hierarchy</b> and <b>Provenance</b> frames can be
resized or even hidden by dragging the sliders that are between each
frame.</p>
