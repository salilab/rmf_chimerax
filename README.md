This is an experimental ChimeraX plugin to read and visualize RMF files.
Currently it will only read and display the first frame from an RMF file and any
2-particle restraints (such as cross-links) although the longer-term goal
is to offer the same functionality as the RMF viewer in legacy Chimera plus
support for newer RMF features, such as provenance.
